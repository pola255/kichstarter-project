# kickstarter-project
Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform with a community of more than 10 million people comprising of creative, tech enthusiasts who help in bringing new projects to life.  Until now, more than $3 billion dollars have been contributed by the members in fueling creative projects. The projects can be literally anything – a device, a game, an app, a film etc.  Kickstarter works on all or nothing basis: a campaign is launched with a certain amount they want to raise, if it doesn’t meet its goal, the project owner gets nothing. For example: if a projects’s goal is $5000. Even if it gets funded till $4999, the project won’t be a success.  The goal is to predict whether it will be successfully funded or not? Looking into the dataset, what useful information can we extract from it, which variables are informative for our prediction and can we interpret the model?  The goal of this project is to build a classifier to predict whether a project will be successfully funded or not.
